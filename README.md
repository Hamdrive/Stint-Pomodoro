## What is it?

A Formula1 driver trains rigorously, to ensure that when the time comes to put `pedal to the medal`, they're doing the best lap times possible.

To be able to do that, they need to be able to follow schedules and ensure completion, accomplish tasks if they want to be the very best.

The average joe like you and me are obviously not racing drivers, but we can always adopt habits from these superhumans.
We too can adopt habits and stick to tasks ensuring we are progressing everyday.

And thus <b>Stint</b> was created.
